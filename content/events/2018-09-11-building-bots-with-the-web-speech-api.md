We're entering a promising new era of computing.

The advance of machine learning and artificial intelligence is reviving interest
in conversational interfaces.  This creates the potential for conversation as
the new mode of interaction with technology.

The big problem is recognizing spoken input has been mostly solved, but a new
challenge has arisen: how to build a user experience that's modelled after
natural human conversation.

This talk outlines the basic mechanics of conversation, introduces core
principles to design by, and presents you with a practical UI to start creating
conversational experiences that engage, delight, and truly help your users.
We'll also be building a voice enabled bot using JavaScript!
