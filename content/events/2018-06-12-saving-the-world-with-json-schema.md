This month's speaker is Rob from
[opendataservices.coop](http://opendataservices.coop/), a tech cooperative which
helps people and organisations publish and use open data in a variety of fields
from international development, government procurement, to philanthropy.

The goal is to help organisations have an impact on the world - to make taxes go
further, to stop corruption, increase the effectiveness of aid, and to help make
sure that charity money goes where it's needed most.

Underpinning all of this JSON Schema (and some XML Schema, if you dig around the
back of the closet).

In this talk we'll hear from Rob about how cooperatives are awesome, what open
data is, and why it's such a good thing. We will see some examples of where
standardised open data has improved lives, and learn about the open data of
Nottingham.
