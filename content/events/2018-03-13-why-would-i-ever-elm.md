This month we are proud to present Josh Hawxwell with a talk on something he is
very passionate about: functional programming!

We'll take a look at some of the many things that the term "functional
programming" can mean, and to what degree that applies to JavaScript. Then we'll
look at how these ideas (which are present in Elm) allow us to easily write safe
front-end applications, with comparisons to other frameworks and packages such
as React and Redux.

After the talk we'll have a workshop session where attendees will be divided
into two groups of AngularJS and React, and discuss the positives and negatives
between re-implementations of a simple Elm app in either framework.

We hope to see you there!
