For our February event we have the lovely DDD East Midlands organisers and all around local legends Jess White & Moreton Brockley helping everyone get a kick start to their public speaking career.

Some details about their talk:

Our tech community is full of bright and interesting people each with their unique experiences and points of view. Every person has valuable content to share, including YOU!

Jessica and Moreton will talk through the benefits of speaking, both to your career and personally. You will learn how to come up with a talk idea, write an abstract and bio for submission and take the first steps to become a speaker. Find out the hints and tips to make this whole experience easier and more enjoyable.

This talk is for all levels. By the end, you will have the tools and inspiration to present to give speaking a try.

Food and drinks will be provided (courtesy of our sponsors) and we'll finish the evening with a drink at the [Canalhouse](https://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/the-canalhouse/) (as usual 🙂).
