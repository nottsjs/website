Laura is heading up to Nottingham to introduce us to Houdini and the things it can do! She'll talk about paint worklets, the [CSSOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model), the layout API, how all these things interact with one another, and why they have the same name!

Join us for Laura's talk, some food and drink, and a chat with your local JS community.

Food and drink are provided by our wonderful sponsors! Just bring yourself ðŸ˜€
