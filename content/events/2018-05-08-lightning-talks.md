Come along this May to see Lightning Talks from members of the community! We
welcome talk proposals beforehand, which we'll gladly assist with, or come along
on the day and put forward a talk!

Been playing with a new package? Found it useful? Come talk!

Solved a deployment issue with TravisCI? Would like to share it? Come talk!

Would like to start using something that you've not had time to look into? Give
it some research and come talk about it!

Anything around JavaScript that you'd like to speak about for between 5 to 15
minutes is welcome! We'll hold 5 mins after each talk for questions, and then
move on to the next one.

Post your lightning talk idea on the issues list and we'll get you scheduled in
<https://github.com/nottsjs/speakers/issues/45>.

See you there!
