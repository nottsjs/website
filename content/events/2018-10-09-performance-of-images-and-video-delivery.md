The average website page weight is 50% images and 25% video.  As the images and
videos delivered to mobile devices get larger and larger, the load time of
websites gets slower and slower.  Further complicating matters, there are
thousands of screens and devices with varying resolutions and CPU power that
receive this content.

In this talk, we’ll examine strategies to send the perfect image or video to
every device, ensuring a fast, beautiful rendering of your content.  We’ll look
at how to test our content, and describe responsive images, delivering
progressive images, and finally optimizing all of this content for fast delivery
to each screen.

Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of how to efficiently
deliver beautiful images to every device that accesses their content.
