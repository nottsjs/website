This month in NottsJS we'll have **Lightning Talks**!

Come along to hear from members of our community, and share your own experiences if you like! Each talk will be 5 minutes each, with **no theme** (does not have to be JS).

You can make slides if you like, but there's no need to prepare, just get up there and talk to us for a few minutes. Hope to see you all there! 💛

We'll have food and drinks provided, courtesy of our sponsors, and go for a drink at [Canalhouse](https://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/the-canalhouse/) to finish it off, as usual 🙂
