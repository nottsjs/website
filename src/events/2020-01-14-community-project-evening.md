Happy new year, NottsJS friends! 🥂🍾

Our community has many skills, and with many skills comes a huge variety of possibilities of things we can make together!

To kick off the new year, we'll have a hands-on session with our very own Dave! 🙂

He'll be running a practical session in which we'll create a temperature monitoring system using an Espruino and some JavaScript.

It should be great fun, so bring your laptop so we can get practical!
Food and drinks will be provided (courtesy of our sponsors) and we'll finish the evening with a drink at the [Canalhouse](https://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/the-canalhouse/) (as usual 🙂).
