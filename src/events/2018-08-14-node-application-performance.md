We all know the benefits performance has on our users, but what are some
_practical_ ways we can improve application performance?

In this talk, we will focus on improving performance, as well as the different
tactics on how to decrease cold starts for your serverless containers.

We'll look at improving TTFB (time to first byte) responses from your express
servers, and _much more!_
