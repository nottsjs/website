Join us for an action packed month as we feature a talk on _Umbraco CMS_,
a _Lean Coffee_, and we see 2018's first edition of the _Cool
Wall!_

We will hear from Paul about how to build websites on the Umbraco framework in
headless mode.  Paul's a great speaker with extensive experience of content
management systems and Umbraco.  Through this talk, you can expect to take away
the skills and knowledge to get to grips quickly with Umbraco's headless mode in
a familiar React setting.

We'll also present an interactive Lean Coffee session where we aim to find out
which technologies, speakers and workshops _YOU_ would like to see at
NottsJS in 2018.

The ever-popular Cool Wall will see a return for 2018, where we will get the
chance to rate the current tech offerings in the form of pseudo-representative
fashion labels related to unspecified yet approximate temperature guides -
"coolness".

See you there!
