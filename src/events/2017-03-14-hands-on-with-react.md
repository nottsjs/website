React is currently my favourite JavaScript framework, and I used
it recently to create the Notts Dev Workshop website.  It led me
to the realisation that NottsJS really should be showcasing
JavaScript based web development.  (I know! Really?!)

Most people don't get to try a new technology in their day-to-day
job, so they do it in their spare time.  These people then don't
get to apply what they've learnt to a real-world problem.

So that's exactly what <strike>I</strike> you will be doing.  My
plan is to <strike>use slave labour</strike> to enable you to
build our website.

I will be acting as your customer and will be signing off your
final work, so expect me to try to give you a live example of
what it means to use this technology in a real setting.

So please join us in building a real-world react website.
