Please join NottsJS and Martin Kearn for "Machine Learning for Muggles".

Artificial Intelligence is the latest hotness. Machine Learning sits behind
artificial intelligence and on the surface it may seem like a deeply technical,
scientific topic. We are here to tell you that it is more accessible than you
think. We'll look at some of the basics around the Azure Machine Learning
service. We'll also look some of the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs which
make it very easy to implement artificial intelligence â€˜smarts' into your
application with simple, standard REST calls via any programming language or
platform, including JavaScript.
