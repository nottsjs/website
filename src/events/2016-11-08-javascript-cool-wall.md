> "You're using <insert\_old\_framework>?  That's so 2015.  You need to use <insert\_new\_framework>!"<br />- _Javascript Developers_

With something that is approaching attention deficit disorder there's new
JavaScript frameworks emerging weekly.  Even the godfather of modern JS
development, jQuery, has been knocked from its perch and is considered pass√©.

So what do we do now?  How do we leverage the good tech, while avoiding the
cargo cults?

This month we're going for something completely new.  Enter The Cool Wall.  A
segment that will prove so popular that Jeremy Clarkson will invent Time Travel
to steal it from us and make into a popular segment on Top Gear.

This month's session will be a group discussion piece where we talk about the
state of modern JavaScript development and our place in this world.
