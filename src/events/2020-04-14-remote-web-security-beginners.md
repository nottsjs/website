#### ðŸŽ¤ Web Security for Complete Beginners (and other people)
_by **Mark Goodwin**_

This talk covers the basics of Web Security at a level suitable for web developers with little or no previous knowledge of security.

Mark will tell you what you need to know common web security problems, how they're exploited, and some things you can do to protect your applications against them.

This talk will also include some useful perspectives for folk who perhaps already know some of the facts.

#### ðŸŽ¤ How not to get pwned by XSS
_by **Samuel King**_

In this talk we will be looking at Cross Site Scripting and how to avoid getting owned by it!
Sam will be covering a variety of different XSS exploits, how to detect them using ZAP, and how a Content Security Policy can be used to prevent XSS attacks.
