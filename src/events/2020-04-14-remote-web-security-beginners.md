#### 🎤 Web Security for Complete Beginners (and other people)
_by **Mark Goodwin**_

This talk covers the basics of Web Security at a level suitable for web developers with little or no previous knowledge of security.

Mark will tell you what you need to know common web security problems, how they're exploited, and some things you can do to protect your applications against them.

This talk will also include some useful perspectives for folk who perhaps already know some of the facts.
