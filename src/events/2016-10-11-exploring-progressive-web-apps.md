> "The application cache is a douchebag"<br />- _Jake Archibald_

Web apps can be pretty cool, but we could be making them _even cooler_. Browsers
are leveling up by adding functionality to enable a user experience akin to
using a native mobile application.

Enter the new buzz-phrase of the moment&hellip; **Progressive Web Apps!**

This talk aims to share knowledge gained from Dan's time at [FullStack
2016](://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7278-fullstack-2016-the-conference-on-javascript-node-and-internet-of-things)
conference, and the lessons learned from implementing the features into real web
applications. The goal is to provide more than just a high level overview; you
should be able to walk away confident that you can implement these features into
your own web apps straight away.

You'll find out why you should care, what's available, see a demo and see what
features are offered in browsers.
