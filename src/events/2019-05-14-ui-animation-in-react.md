> This talk will be given remotely.

Small UI animations can make a big difference in the quality and ease of use of our apps. In this talk we'll look at ways we can approach building small, effective animations using CSS, incorporating them into a theme, and using a helpful package to make useful, consistent animation easy to build.

We have some prizes to give away to attendees of this event! Be sure to attend to be in with a chance of winning a free pass for [Donovan's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/level-up-your-css-animation-skills/)!
