  Before joining IBM Cloud Data Services Matt was the Head of the Development
  team at Web.com UK, overseeing the development of a range of web services with
  PHP, Node.JS, Cloudant, Amazon Redshift and Redis. Most of his experience is
  in creating whitelabel search, presence and CRM products designed to be used
  at scale by third parties.


  Matt has a particular interest in anything to do with realtime apps and
  football - currently looking for an excuse to combine the two!

In today's online world, user experience is key. Users expect slick interfaces
that are intuitive, informative and engaging. More and more, building apps that
update the user in Realtime are becoming an essential part of this experience
- and we can see this every day with things like Google Docs, Facebook
Notifications, Slack and BBC Live Text.

RethinkDB is a fully featured, opensource, NoSQL database designed to make
developing for the Realtime Web easy. We'll talk about changefeeds, clustering
and how combining with Node.js can help you avoid some of the pitfalls of
building rich, engaging, Realtime Apps to scale and across multiple platforms.

By the end of this talk you'll be ready to go back and create your first
Realtime App with RethinkDB and Node.js.
