Hello JS friends!

For our December event, weâ€™re planning a laid back closure to the year ðŸ˜Š

Dave and Carol, along with a few of the NottsJS community members, will be attending dotJS next week, so we thought itâ€™d be nice for them to share their favourite bits of the conference.

And then, weâ€™ll have a Christmas quiz! Weâ€™ll have prizes to be won, but weâ€™re mainly looking to have some Christmassy fun. Hope to see you there!

Food and drinks will be provided (courtesy of our sponsors) and weâ€™ll finish the evening with a drink at the [Canalhouse](https://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/the-canalhouse/) (as usual ðŸ™‚).
