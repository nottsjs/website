> This talk will be given remotely.

Serverless is becoming mainstream, but sometimes it is being abused more than it is being used correctly.

In this talk David will explain his reasons to be careful on the use cases for serverless and showcase an example on how to build a identity verification system with a single lambda on GCP, integrating with the Vision API.
