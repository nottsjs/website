Come see how you can make mobile apps with javascript using React.Native,
facebook's framework for building mobile apps.

This will be a hands-on workshop, where Windows users can create an Android App,
and Mac users get to choose Android or iPhone.

You will need Android studio or xcode installed to get the simulators up and
running.
