  Will read about Elm in late 2015, and has been using it for the last six
  months or so. Before then he was using React/Redux and vanilla JS.

  Will has been working on a donations application that will build wealth
  redistribution into everyday transactions.  As far as he knows,
  [Helpfreely](https://www.helpfreely.org) have made the most progress in the
  donate-while-you-shop space. Will hopes to be working with them soon.

  Will also helps to administer the [Nottingham chapter of Free Code
  Camp](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.nottingham/), the free
  online course where members learn to code and help nonprofits.

> elm. A delightful language for reliable webapps.<br />-
> _[elm-lang.org](http://elm-lang.org/)_

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org) is a domain-specific, purely functional programming
language used for declaratively creating client-side web apps which compile to
JavaScript.

In this talk you'll be shown _The Elm Architecture_, a nestable pattern for
building applications, and Elm's full type inference system that helps prevent
users from running into errors.

We'll look at how Elm handles HTTP requests and websockets, how it handles
uncertainty, the use of partial function application for reusable views,
interaction with JS libraries, and how data immutability gives you undo/redo for
only a few lines of code.
