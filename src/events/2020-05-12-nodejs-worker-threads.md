This month we'll be presenting a talk from James covering Node.js Worker Threads which became [stable in version 12](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/worker_threads.html).

We'll hear about what they are, how they work, the challenges with using them, and the challenges we have with profiling them.

This talk is sure to have a lot of technical insight into a feature we will see in use every day. As tooling mature, Worker Threads promise to become the standard way to build highly performant Node.js apps.
