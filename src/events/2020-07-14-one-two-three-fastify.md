We're joined this month by Matteo Collina, author of the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io) web framework, with a talk and live coding demo of how to get started with Fastify.

Along with conference speaking experience, Matteo is an incredible developer who likes a challenge, especially ðŸ”´ live coding over the Internet!

In this demo he will show us how to go from _`import` to App_ with a rare opportunity to ask him questions about Fastify, Pino, Node, or any other of the myriad of projects he works on.
