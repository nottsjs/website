### Bring your laptop!

This month we will be running a fun and collaborative practical session with
[WarriorJS](https://warrior.js.org/).

> An exciting game of programming and Artificial Intelligence

WarriorJS is a coding challenge structured around the concept of a dungeon
crawler game where the programmer plays a warrior attempting to solve challenges
in each level.

Players will to take turns in each attempt at solving the current level in
[Randori Kata](https://codingdojo.org/RandoriKata/) style, with teams of up to 4
people and one laptop rotating through the driver seat.

We hope you enjoy this chance to code purely for fun (sorry, no prizes!)
