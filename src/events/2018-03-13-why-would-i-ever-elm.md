  Josh is an eccentric developer living in Nottingham with a background in
  mathematics and computing.  He has a keen interest in many languages including
  Go, Elm and Ruby, but prefers to kick back with .NET in his day job.

  Josh can usually be found creating small apps and tools for various personal
  interests such as media controls and photography - he never fails to surprise

This month we are proud to present Josh Hawxwell with a talk on something he is
very passionate about: functional programming!

We'll take a look at some of the many things that the term "functional
programming" can mean, and to what degree that applies to JavaScript. Then we'll
look at how these ideas (which are present in Elm) allow us to easily write safe
front-end applications, with comparisons to other frameworks and packages such
as React and Redux.

After the talk we'll have a workshop session where attendees will be divided
into two groups of AngularJS and React, and discuss the positives and negatives
between re-implementations of a simple Elm app in either framework.

We hope to see you there!
