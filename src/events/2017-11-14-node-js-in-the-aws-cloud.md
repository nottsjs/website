_Due to unforeseeable problems, we have had to cancel the Amazon Alexa talk by
David Low, and are replacing it with another talk about Node JS in the Cloud.
We are looking to reschedule the Amazon Alexa talk for January._

During this session we will aim to build a server-less RESTful API based upon
Amazon's AWS cloud technologies.

This is intended as a high-level hands-on session, where you can get exposure to
a wide number of intersecting technologies, giving us the opportunity to do a
deep dive on each individual component in future sessions.

In this session we will use: Node JS, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM Security &
Document DB.

These will be included into a Blue Peter style "here's one I made earlier" React
Website to show off the capabilities.

If you are planning on joining in then please [register for an Amazon AWS
account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) BEFORE the event. Amazon
offer a 12 month free tier which will cover your needs, but you will need to
supply payment details.
