  Josh is an eccentric developer living in Nottingham with a background in mathematics and computing. He has a keen interest in many languages including JavaScript, Go, Elm and Ruby, but prefers to kick back with .NET in his day job.

  Josh can usually be found creating small apps and tools for various personal interests such as media controls and photography - he never fails to surprise his followers on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hawx-/).

We are not in control of social networks, but we use them for most of our
interactions online. They get to decide how our content is shown, may not
provide us programmatic access to it, and try to run annoying adverts around it
(if they bother to create a "business plan"), then shut down in a couple of
years and your content is gone.

It can be difficult to decide to put content on websites we own because there
isn't a ready made group of people to connect and share it with. By using
standards from the IndieWeb we can connect our personal sites with others to get
the benefits of a social network while owning our content.

In this talk, you'll see how we can authenticate ourselves, share posts, reply
to and like content, and combine our personal sites with our existing social
network profiles.
