The most common use of JavaScript for game development is to recreate a classic game of Pong or Breakout, often to practice the language.

However, there are many more possibilities within game development than just plain HTML and JavaScript and many are fantastic for developing new skills or for a fun side project.

In this talk, we will be discussing various techniques of developing 2D and 3D games for web, mobile and even smartwatch. We'll be covering general concepts of development and touching on various frameworks to enhance these different areas, such as [Pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) and [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/), which can transform a simple 2D browser game to a fully fledged mobile or desktop game.

There will also be additional mentions of integrating well-known technologies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), into our games to make the jump into game development less of a learning curve than you may think.

Food and drinks will be provided (courtesy of our sponsors) and we'll finish the evening with a drink at the [Canalhouse](https://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/the-canalhouse/) (as usual 🙂).
