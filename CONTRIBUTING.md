## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Contribute

We accept Pull Requests to this repository using GitHub forks. You can learn more about creating a fork and how to keep it up to date in the GitHub documentation at [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

Once you've made all your changes and are ready to request that we merge them into the website code, open up a Pull Request. See: [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

Once we have reviewed your Pull Request (PR) you may have feedback asking for changes. Have a discussion about this feedback using the PR commenting tools, and if you want to implement feedback, make the changes to your fork. Normally, this will automatically reflect the changes in the PR, unless you are pointing the PR at a specific branch. In this case, make the changes to that branch.

At the end of the process, your PR will be merged and your code will go live on the website üéâ

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Coding Style

The coding style of the website is always evolving, however there is tooling which will run automatically and inform you of any issues. Obey and rectify these issues before you open the PR to avoid any feedback that asks for these to be fixed. This will smooth other the process!
