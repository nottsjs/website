Dot catch!<br />- <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/codesleuth/\">David Wood</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many of us know about the benefits of offloading concurrent I/O operations\nthrough the use of callbacks, libraries such as async and bluebird, or using the\nnew Promise support in browsers and Node.js. But, do you know how these work,\nand when you should use them?</p>\n<p>In this talk we will review the benefits, pitfalls, and ways to implement\nconcurrent JavaScript code in Node.js and the browser. We'll look at the support\nfor <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, how this differs from callbacks and asynchronous libraries,\nand take a brief look at how these have been implemented to gain a better\nunderstanding of what's going on under the hood.</p>\n<p>At the end of this talk you will be able to make more informed decisions about\nthe use of synchronous API methods such as readFileSync, choosing to listen to\nerror events, and why wrapping function calls in <code>try..catch</code> may or\nmay not be useful.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/events/2017-10-10-being-asynchronous/","title":"Being Asynchronous","start":"2017-10-10T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2017-10-10T20:00:00.000Z","meetup_url":null,"presenter":"David Wood","presenter_bio":"\nDave is a Contract Software Developer currently working at\n[nearForm](https://www.nearform.com/).
