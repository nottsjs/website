Then we'll\nlook at how these ideas (which are present in Elm) allow us to easily write safe\nfront-end applications, with comparisons to other frameworks and packages such\nas React and Redux.</p>\n<p>After the talk we'll have a workshop session where attendees will be divided\ninto two groups of AngularJS and React, and discuss the positives and negatives\nbetween re-implementations of a simple Elm app in either framework.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you there!</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/events/2018-03-13-why-would-i-ever-elm/","title":"Why would I ever Elm","start":"2018-03-13T18:30:00.000Z","end":"2018-03-13T21:00:00.000Z","meetup_url":"https://www.meetup.com/NottsJS/events/jrhlfpyxfbrb/","presenter":"Joshua Hawxwell","presenter_bio":"\nJosh is an eccentric developer living in Nottingham with a background in\nmathematics and computing.
